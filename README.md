## üåç Internationalization

The plugin supports multiple languages:

| Language | Code | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| English | `en_US` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| German | `de_DE` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| French | `fr_FR` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Spanish | `es_ES` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Chinese (Simplified) | `zh_CN` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Norwegian (Bokm√•l) | `nb_NO` | ‚úÖ Complete |

To use a specific language, add this to your `user/config.php`:
```php
define('YOURLS_LANG', 'de_DE'); // Replace with your preferred language code
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Storage Location
You can customize where files are stored by modifying the storage location in the admin settings. The path should be:
- **Web-accessible**: Files need to be accessible via HTTP
- **Writable**: The web server must have write permissions
- **Secure**: Outside the web root for security (recommended)

### File Retention Policies
Configure automatic file cleanup:
- **Never**: Keep files indefinitely
- **24 Hours**: Delete after 1 day
- **7 Days**: Delete after 1 week
- **31 Days**: Delete after 1 month
- **90 Days**: Delete after 3 months
- **Custom**: Set your own retention period

### Security Considerations
- Files are validated for type and content
- Path traversal attacks are prevented
- CSRF protection is enabled
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Upload directory is protected with .htaccess

### CyberPanel & LiteSpeed Compatibility
The plugin includes .htaccess rules that are fully compatible with:
- **OpenLiteSpeed**: Standard Apache-compatible directives
- **LiteSpeed Enterprise**: Enhanced with optional LiteSpeed-specific optimizations
- **CyberPanel**: Seamless integration with CyberPanel's file management
- **AlmaLinux**: Tested and optimized for AlmaLinux 9.6 and 10

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File uploads not working:**
- Check directory permissions (should be 755 for directories, 644 for files)
- Verify upload directory exists and is writable
- Check PHP upload limits in php.ini

**Short URLs not redirecting:**
- Ensure the upload directory is web-accessible
- Check that files are being moved to the correct location
- Verify .htaccess rules are working

**Frontend uploads not showing:**
- Check that "Enable Frontend Uploads" is set to "Yes" in admin settings
- Verify the custom frontend is loading the plugin correctly
- Check for PHP errors in the error log

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by adding this to your `user/config.php`:
```php
define('YOURLS_DEBUG', true);
```
